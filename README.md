# Face Recognition System using Python Tkinter GUI and HOG

## Description

Our Face Recognition System is a robust and efficient application built using Python Tkinter GUI and the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) algorithm. It empowers users to perform accurate and secure face recognition and authentication. The user-friendly graphical interface ensures seamless integration and ease of use for diverse applications, including access control, attendance management, and identity verification.

## Features

- **Powerful Face Recognition**: The system leverages the HOG algorithm to achieve precise and reliable face recognition.

- **User-Friendly GUI**: The Python Tkinter-based GUI provides a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- **Face Detection**: The system can detect and extract faces from images or live video streams.

- **Face Authentication**: It matches detected faces with those in the database for authentication purposes.

- **Customizable and Versatile**: The system is easily customizable and can be integrated into various projects and applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the application using `python main.py`.

## Usage

1. Launch the application through the command-line or IDE.
2. Register faces: Capture and store images of individuals to create a face database.
3. Face Recognition: Use the system to recognize and authenticate faces from images or real-time video streams.
4. View Results: The GUI will display the identified faces and their associated information.
